					<h4>Information</h4>
					<p class="intro">
						It’s been a few months since I made this <code class="opacity">~/now</code> page (and my inaugural quarterly update). So, I’m back with the latest news about what’s been happening in my personal and
						professional life.
					</p>
					<p>
						At <a href="/archiving/axiom/">Axiom</a> I’ve been continuing to make a series of patterns from typographic characters for swag, ads, sales collateral, and the site redesign. You can see an example with the
						new t-shirt design <code class="opacity zero">(TS-02)</code> using the <code class="opacity">></code> character to make the Axiom logo mark. It’s proving to be a very fun and flexible system to use
						<a href="https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono">Berkeley Mono</a> as a constant through the brand and design direction. As we build on the diagrams and patterns I can see a lot of potential to
						play and experiment further with motion and interaction. Exciting.
					</p>
					<p>
						I recently finished up working with a coach that was organised as part of some professional development for the team. I’ve done some coaching before, and having another chance to be coached was a great
						opportunity to reflect and consider what I’ve learnt, as well as what areas I want to work on improving. It made me think a lot about this quote:
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							“Leadership is a journey in self awareness.” <br />
							<span class="quote">&mdash; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Bloomfield">Sir Ashley Bloomfield</a> <span class="opacity">(KNZM)</span></span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>
						There’s two kinds of <a href="https://hbr.org/2018/01/what-self-awareness-really-is-and-how-to-cultivate-it">self awareness</a>, internal and external. The longer I work with different people and companies,
						I’ve been able to see more clearly my own skills/flaws, through combining how I see myself (internal), and how others see me (external). I also believe there’s a lot of benefits in viewing leadership in a
						less traditional sense by finding ways to bring your personality and individuality to the role/responsibilities. Doing so can more positively impact culture, expectations, and connection within teams.
					</p>
					<p>
						Alongside being professionally coached, I’ve been informally helping a handful of friends and old colleagues with various things like redundancies, interview practice, portfolio reviews, résumé editing, case
						study feedback, general career advice, recruitment and team management.
					</p>
					<p>
						As I gather my thoughts from both being coached and informally coaching others, I’ve realised I really enjoy helping others, so if you think I can help, <a href="/contactable/">get in touch</a>. <br />
						<span class="opacity small">NB: I’ve been doing these coaching sessions over lunch or in the evenings, so have limited time slots available.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside of work I submitted two posters to <a href="https://www.typehere.co.nz">Type Here</a>, a local design competition. The posters needed to reflect the theme ‘Aotearoa Now’ with the suggestion “this may
						take the form of personal interpretation, political message or expression of aroha.”
					</p>
					<p>
						I took a somewhat literal interpretation, by looking into the latest population and ethnicity data to see how many people “now” live in Aotearoa (5,374,562) based on offical estimates at the time the poster
						was designed. Similarly, with the river centerline design I wanted to comment on the current state of our environment. You can read more about the posters below, or see a larger image on my
						<a href="/experimenting/">WIP</a> page.
					</p>
					<p>
						One of the reasons I was motivated to submit these two posters to the competition was that I’m disappointed in our governments rhetoric about Māori and
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Waitangi">Te Tiriti o Waitangi</a>. Based on the 2023
						<a href="https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/2023-census-population-counts-by-ethnic-group-age-and-maori-descent-and-dwelling-counts/">census data</a> “almost 1 million New Zealanders [are] of
						Māori descent”. We should be honouring our indigenous culture and language, not removing the use of Te Reo Māori from government departments. The other reason is the “fast track” process for new bills that’s
						impacting environmental policies and our commitments on climate change.
					</p>
					<p>
						Everywhere I look, things are feeling increasingly polarising and divisive, with genocide, fascism, war, U.S politics etc. It’s a very depressing and concering time, which makes me think of this Māori
						whakataukī (proverb):
					</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							Waiho i te toipoto, kaua i te toiroa. <br />
							Let us keep close together, not wide apart. <br />
							<span class="quote opacity">The Raupō Book of Māori Proverbs Te Kohikohinga Whakataukī A Raupō <br />&#8985; A.E. Broughham & A.W. Reed. Revised by Tīmoti Kāretu</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p></p>
					<p>
						In more positive news, Ada turned six, and in keeping with tradition we made her a peanut butter birthday cake! After chicken, it’s her favourite thing, with peanut butter biscuits a regular snack.
						<span class="opacity small">NB: If you’re going to get inspired and cook your floof treats, dogs can only eat unsalted peanut butter.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						There’s been a lot of long walks around the peninsula, and as many beach visits as possible in between the winter rain. Ada’s also starting to enjoy a new change in routine where we dog-sit a friends’ puppy
						called Happy every Monday. Insert band joke... They get on really well and it’s a great way to start the week having two dogs doing zoomies.
					</p>
					<p>And finally, some other highlights/updates include:</p>
					<div class="small opacity-light">
						<p>
							<span class="opacity">&mdash;</span> Getting to see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Again">Fred again..</a> for the first time, not again. So impressive, and it fascinates me he can arrive in
							the country a couple days before the show and then sell out the gig!
						</p>
						<p><span class="opacity">&mdash;</span> I continue to watch a lot of comedy, and went to see Chopper. Also went to see Tom Sainsbury. Both are very different styles, but equally hilarious.</p>
						<p>
							<span class="opacity">&mdash;</span> I watched some of the T20 World Cup, which could be described as comedy based on how woeful New Zealand played. It sadly feels like an end of an era with a lot of key
							players on the cusp of retirement (and many already retired).
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="opacity">&mdash;</span> I randomly purchased a new LEGO set and on a rainy weekend had a lot more fun than expected building wild flowers out of obscure and repurposed plastic parts, like
							pirate hats, wheels, and oars!
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="opacity">&mdash;</span> We’ve been rewatching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Robot">Mr. Robot</a>. Five years on it’s an uncanny watch with reference to Trump, cybersecurity hacks,
							and crypto currency. It’s a brilliant show, and absolutely holds up on a rewatch. 10/10.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="opacity">&mdash;</span> I got a couple of new books of note, <a href="https://www.niggli.ch/en/produkt/mono-is-the-new-black-e/">Mono is the New Black</a>, and
							<a href="https://order.design/project/classified">Classified</a>, an amazing collection of local ads from small towns across America. Basically just more of the aesthetic I’m currently obsessed with.
						</p>
						<p>
							<span class="opacity">&mdash;</span> Not much has changed around the site. I added a new photo to the <a href="/informing/">about</a> page. It’s from our trip to NYC when
							<a href="https://anoushkaisaac.com">Noush</a> and I visited the Color Factory. Don’t worry, the photo is in black and white.

					<p class="opacity">Below are the detailed descriptions for the two posters submitted to Type Here.</p>
					<p><span class="opacity zero">01.</span> Aotearoa New Zealand — Population/Ethnicity:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>This poster is a snapshot of the population and ethnicity of Aotearoa New Zealand showing the diversity and distribution of people across our regions.</p>
						<p>
							Using 2024 population estimates and recently released 2023 census data from Tatauranga Aotearoa (Stats NZ) the design highlights the (estimated) number of people living here at the time the poster was
							created (30/06/2024), along with our largest ethnic groups, and the regions across Te Ika-a-Māui (North Island) and Te Waipounamu (South Island) where they live.
						</p>
						<p>
							Of the people who call Aotearoa New Zealand home, one out of four were born overseas, with more than 200 different ethnicities living here. The country is divided into sixteen regions, with three out of
							four people living across the nine regions in Te Ika-a-Māui/North Island.

					<p><span class="opacity zero">02.</span> Aotearoa New Zealand — River Centrelines:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>This poster provides commentary on the environmental impact the agriculture and forestry industries have had on our awa (rivers).</p>
						<p>
							Using river centrelines data from Toitū Te Whenua (Land Information New Zealand), the map of Aotearoa New Zealand is central to this design to illustrate the scale of our awa. Alongside the map are three

					<h4>Information</h4>
					<p class="intro">
						I’ve been meaning to make a <code class="opacity">~/now</code> page (inspired by <a href="https://nownownow.com">NowNowNow</a>). Now I have one. This is a summary of what’s been happening in my personal and
						professional life.
					</p>
					<p>To start 2024 I’ve been looking back on the last few year/s. Phew. Way too many things to list and process. Some day I’ll write all about it.</p>
					<p>For now, I made a page (and year in review reel) documenting the WIP redesign of <a href="/archiving/axiom/">Axiom</a>.</p>
					<p>
						A huge influence has been the use of <a href="https://berkeleygraphics.com/typefaces/berkeley-mono">Berkeley Mono</a> as our brand typeface, lots of IBM’s design system, older interfaces, dense UI, and
						terminal screens. It’s been rewarding to find a style the team (and customers) love. There’s a long way to go, but I’m really excited with this direction.
					</p>
					<p>
						Outside of work, I have been making changes around here and made this page, a new <a href="/designing/">portfolio</a> page, <a href="/informing/">about</a> page, and <a href="/contactable/">contact</a> page
						(instead of annoyingly opening your email app when you click the contact link). The homepage had got too long over time, so work and personal information is now split into separate pages.
					</p>
					<p>
						I’ve really enjoyed continuing to tinker with the site. Sometimes it’s been small changes I think of, or a weekend of making larger improvements. Mostly for no reason, and I’m not in the market for a new job.
						I’ve just seen (and experienced) the stress of not having an up-to-date portfolio and CV, so I now take the approach that it’s never done, and I work on the site for fun.
					</p>
					<p>
						It’s also a chance to document the aesthetic and design principles I follow. This is the fourth “version” of the site since I moved to this domain in 2011. It’s mostly looked similar for each iteration, so
						the versions have just meant there’s more pages, images, lists, and nerdier details.
					</p>
					<p>As the site has evolved, I’ve started to collect some of my favourite quotes (with the intention they’ll have their own page soon) that reflect how I think about design and creativity:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							“The enemy of great is almost great.”<br />
							<span class="quote">&mdash; The Edge <span class="opacity">(U2)</span></span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<p>
							“He toi whakairo, he mana tangata. Where there is artistic excellence, there is human dignity.”<br />
							<span class="quote">&mdash; Piri Sciascia <span class="opacity">(OMNZ, Kaumātua)</span></span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>

						Related, I recently stumbled across <a href="https://cosmos.so/danserif">Cosmos</a>. It’s like Pinterest, but with a much better UI design and focus on quality/creative work. I’ve not really taken to these
						curation tools, so this time I have made more of an effort to document a lot of the things/people/design that inspires me. There’s currently clusters of images for typography, black and white graphic design,
						mono fonts, logos, Apple, Braun, Sony, Vitsœ, IBM, and my favourite artist, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Apple">Billy Apple</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						I’m currently reading <a href="https://shifthappens.site">Shift Happens</a>, an incredibly detailed book about keyboards, by Marcin Wichary. Spoiler: unfortunately the book is now sold out. There’s so many
						fascinating stories and details, all rigorously sourced and documented. The care and attention to detail Marcin has put into the book, throughout the entire production, is equally as impressive as the
						information in it. You can read all about what went into creating the book in his <a href="https://newsletter.shifthappens.site/">newsletter</a>, which I highly recommend. There’s also a dedicated
						<a href="https://shifthappens.site/companion/">book companion</a> site!
					</p>
					<p>
						<a href="https://anoushkaisaac.com">Noush</a> has a new full-time job after getting struck by a layoff (uncannily about a year after I did). She’s found a great new role, but it’s damn tough out there. Also,
						in the midst of all of that, Ada got attacked by a Rottweiler! Absolute nightmare. We’re very lucky it wasn’t any worse than it was. Thankfully she’s doing better and there hopefully isn’t any lasting impact.
						For a lot of reasons, I’m very grateful to work from home. It really helped to have the flexibility and time to deal with an unexpected drama like this. It also means Ada is nearly always by my side.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, I got really sick in 2023. I’m doing better now, but unsurprisingly it has changed my outlook on everything. It’s a cliché, but I simply just spend a lot more time doing the things I enjoy, with the
						people/dog (Noush & Ada) I care about.
					</p>
					<p>I also cannot recommend laughing enough, it really is the best medicine.</p>
