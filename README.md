# Kia ora. Hello.
## I’m Dan Newman, a Creative Director at [Springload](https://springload.co.nz), from Te Whanganui-a-Tara/Wellington, Aotearoa/New Zealand.

You can normally find me tweeting on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/danserif), applying black and white filters to photos (mainly of my dog Ada) on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/danserif), listening to The National’s music on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/user/danserif), tracking films on [Letterboxd](https://www.letterboxd.com/danserif), occasionally dribbbling shots on [Dribbble](https://www.dribbble.com/danserif), periodically pinning things of interest on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/danserif), copying and pasting code from [Github](https://www.github.com/danserif), being serious on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danserif) and less so on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/danserif).
